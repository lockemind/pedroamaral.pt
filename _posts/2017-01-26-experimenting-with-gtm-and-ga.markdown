## Experimenting with Google Tag Manager and Google Analytics

As I am preparing some work for a client i gathered some resources that are proving useful to better understand
the different use cases and implementation possibilities.

I found a very simple and to the point course that explains the basics of using GTM to implement GA Event triggering.

The same youtube channel has loads of other GTM related content:

There is also a course [Google Tag Manager Fundamentals](https://analyticsacademy.withgoogle.com/course/5) on google
academy more on the theoretical side of the marketing to analytics.

I will also take advantage of these posts to test these techniques on this post itself.
